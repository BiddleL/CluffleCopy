# Cluffle

This project is for all those glorious lazy people out there who love reddit a bit too much.

From now on you are able to browse reddit while at work - it will look like you are using Google.



# Notice

Just to let you know, because of copyright things and stuff I decided to remove some graphics before making everything public.

Also, PLEASE, don't judge me by that code. Most of it was written at 3-5am. I'm not that sane at that time. I coded cruel, cruel things. Unspeakable things. I'm sorry.
